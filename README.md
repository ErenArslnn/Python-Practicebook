# Python-Practicebook 📘  

This repository contains Python scripts from my personal studies, focusing on building a **strong foundation** in Python.  

### 🎯 Why This Repository?  
As an **entry-level data analyst candidate**, I am currently enhancing my **SQL proficiency** while strengthening my Python skills. My primary expertise lies in **data analysis, cleaning, and visualization** using Python (`pandas`), as showcased in my **pinned projects**.  

This repository documents my **step-by-step learning journey**, covering Python fundamentals up to intermediate-level concepts. In the future, I plan to explore **OOP techniques** and **deep learning libraries (e.g., Keras)** to expand my capabilities.  

### 🔍 What's Next?  
I will soon begin publishing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects** using **SQL and Power BI** to demonstrate my analytical skills in real-world datasets.  

📌 **Note:**  
All exercises here are based on publicly available **free course materials** and structured learning roadmaps.  

🚀 Stay tuned for upcoming projects!
