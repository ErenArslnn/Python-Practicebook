# In this study we will learn the basics of defining functions and how to use them:

# Defining a function:
def greet():
    print("Hello World")

# Using a function:
greet()


# Basic application:
def mySum():
    print("a + b calculator")
    a = int(input("a :"))    
    b = int(input("b :"))
    print(a + b)

mySum()
